    <h1 class="intro">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="text">Almost everything in our lives, from the cars we drive to the movies we watch to how businesses and governments interact
    with us, includes<br> computing and computer technology. An educated individual in the twenty-first century needs to have a
    certain set of skills, one of which is<br>an understanding of the various computer dimensions. Studying computing can give
    you knowledge that is useful whether your goal is to<br> become a scientist, create the newest killer application, or simply
    understand what is meant when someone says "the machine made a mistake."</p>
    <h1 class="intro">Six reasons to study Computer Science</h1>
   <h2 class="intro">1. The world needs computer scientists</h2>
   <p class="text">Computer programmes directly affect every aspect of our lives; we rely on computer scientists for this. Computer
scientists theories, design, develop<br> and apply the software and hardware for technology most of us use every single day.
As the digital world is rapidly evolving, the need for computer<br> scientists continues to grow.</p>
    <h2 class="intro">2. Excellent graduate prospects</h2>
    <p class="text">Computer Science students stand a good chance of being professionally employed (or in further study) within six months
    of graduating.</p>
    <h2 class="intro">3. Good starting salaries</h2>
    <p class="text">Computer scientists are in demand, and the salaries on offer reflect this. Take a look at what you could earn as a
    graduate.</p>
    <h2 class="intro">4. Needed in almost every industry</h2>
    <p class="text">Computers are used in virtually every industry, so computer scientists can take their pick. Computers can solve problems
    in science, engineering,<br> healthcare and so many other areas. It's up to the computer scientist to figure out how to
    design software that applies the solution.</p>
    <h2 class="intro">5. Internationally diverse</h2>
    <p class="text">Computer Science departments typically have very culturally diverse cohorts. Thousands of students come from overseas to
    study the subject<br> in the UK every year. You'll benefit from learning alongside people from different cultures and
    possibly finish university with an international<br> network of contacts.</p>
    <h2 class="intro">6. Year abroad opportunities</h2>
    <p class="text">Check out the opportunities for overseas study on the courses that interest you. A year abroad will provide you with a
    deeper understanding<br> of how computers are utilized around the world, allowing you to experience other cultures and
    potentially gain some language skills in the process.</p>
